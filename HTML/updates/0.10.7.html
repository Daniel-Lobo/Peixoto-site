    <pre> 
      - Refactoring of the Direct3D (9 and earlier) user mode display driver hooks. 
        These hooks are used to allow pixel shaders on Direct3D 7 and earlier, allow 
        HLSL shaders on Direct3D 8, fix w fog on some Direct3D 7 and earlier games and
        to fix a transparency bug on Star wars dark forces II. The refactoring aims to 
        improve the maintainability of the code. This hooks will also be the base for 
        future fixes related to alpha testing and z bias bugs in some games 
        
      - Improved the detection of transformed vertices on Direct3D 9 when forced 
        resolution is enabled. Transformed vertices have to be correctly detected 
        because they have to scaled on the CPU. 
        
      - Fixed a bug on the IDirect3DSurface8::GetDesc and 
        IDirect3DDevice8::CreatePixelShader hooks that crashed some games
        
      - Improved compatibility of FidelityFx super resolution upscaling on both
        Direct3D 11 and 12   
        
      - Added the QueryPerformanceCounter fix. This fix changes the behavior of the 
        QueryPerformanceCounter function to report not the number of counts since 
        windows was started, but since the current process was started. This was 
        implemented to fix low frame rates on Jade empire, but i've heard of other 
        games that need this as well. Since timeGetTime calls are redirected to 
        QueryPerformanceCounter when the high resolution timers options is enabled, 
        this option can fix games that use that function as well
        
      - Small refactoring of the Saves redirection feature. A new option to handle 
        Xlive games was added. A code path that handled Unreal 1 and 2 games was 
        removed, but instructions on how to adapt the system links option to these 
        games were added  
        
      - Integrated a Fix created by others that disables TXAA on control   
        
      - Added 9 new games: 4 which benefit from forced resolution because they shrink
        their UIs, HUD or texts on higher resolutions: Jade Empire, 
        Start Trek Elite Force 2, Star Trek: Deep Space Nine - The Fallen and Enclave. 
        3 which benefit from  FidelityFx super resolution: The Talos Priciple, 
        Death's Door, and Resident Evil 2 Remake. Finally, another 3 games
        on which forced resolution is not entirely necessary, but benefit from it because
        it allows super sampling anti aliasing: Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force, 
        The Void and Sudeki
