    <h3 class='tile'>This version was lost and is not included in the old versions download link</h3>
    <pre> 
        - Direct3D 12 support added. Only one feature supported a the moment,
          <a href='Https://Www.Amd.Com/En/Technologies/Radeon-Software-Fidelityfx-Super-Resolution'>FidelityFx super resolution</a>          

        - Added FidelityFx super resolution to Direct3D 11 games and removed forced 
          resolution in Direct3D 10 and 11 until it is in a more usable state 

        - Added an option to set the affinity of threads making calls to Direct3D 8 to a
          single core. This option was made to fix crashes in Soul Reaver 2 without 
          causing sound glitches - setting single core affinity to the process frequently
          causes it - and may be useful in other games too
        
        - Added FidelityFx super resolution to Unravel row

        - Added Control - D3D11 and D3D12 - with FidelityFx super
          resolution support
