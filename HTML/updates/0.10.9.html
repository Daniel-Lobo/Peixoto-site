    <h3 class='tile'>DirectInput focused update with the peixoto's patch 1st Passthrough layer
    </h3>    
    <h3>PASSTHTOUGH LAYERS</h3>
    <p>The Passthought layers are fundamental to make peixoto's patch "future proof". Peixoto's patch does most of what it does 
    by intercepting and modifying the communication between the game and DirectX. Microsoft uses the exact same method to 
    maintain the compatibility of their older APIs, and the hooks - peixoto's and Microsoft's - can sometimes conflict. 
    Currently, theses conflicts are handled case by case, but while Microsoft doesn't update the old APIs anymore, they update 
    their compatibility layers, and those updates offten re-introduce previously solved conflicts, so I need a more robust 
    method to handle those conflicts. This is the purpose of the passthought layers</p>
    <p>The Passthrough layers are a fake DirectX layer the passes unmodified DirectX 
    calls from the game to DirectX. With the layer alone we would have something like this:<br><br>
    
    Game &#8594; Passthrough layer (Fake DirectX) &#8594; Real DirectX<br><br>
    
    but when we put peixoto's and Microsoft's hooks on the picture, the layer isolates them 
    from each other<br><br>
    
    Game &#8594; Peixoto's hooks &#8594; Fake DirectX &#8594;MS Shims &#8594; Real DirectX<br><br>
    
    The Passthrough layers will also make Peixoto's path compatible with other 
    wrappers and solves problems with inheritance, which are aways a pain to handle<br><br>

    The 1st Passthrough layer is for DIRECTINPUT. It's a simple layer, so ot was 
    the best one to start. Without going into much detail, the hard ones will be 
    DirectDraw\Direct3D <=7, even DirectX 10 and latter will be easy.
    With the layer, I've also implemented several fixes and additions on DirectInput</p>

    <h3>DIRECTINPUT</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Fixed the reporting of the analog sticks position which as broken in many games  
        <li> Fixed mapping of the thumbsticks buttons, whick could be mapped to a different DirectInput button as the one intended
        <li> Added support for games the use custom data formats to retrieve gamepad data
        <li> Added support for games the retrieve buffered data instead of immediate data 
        <li> Improved force feedback support. I know very little games that use force feedback, so this didn't have a lot of testing
    </ul>

    <h3>OPENGL</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed bugs on the glDrawPixels and glBitmap hooks, Affects Strangers Wrath and blade of darkness
        <li>Fixed super sampling anti aliasing, affects Alone in the Dark, Sphinyx, Strangers Wrath and maybe others  
    </ul>      
        
    <h3>DIRECT9</h3>  
    <ul>
        <li>Fixed a bug rendering texts - used to search for texture and shaders - on Direct3D9Ex
        <li>Broke &#x1F610 texture swapping in half life 2
    </ul>         
    
    <h3>ALL GRAPHICS APIS</h3> 
    <ul> 
        <li>Fixed a bug on the EnumDisplaySettingsExW Hook. When enumerating the current resolution, this function would return the display height 
        incorrectly - equal to the width. I found this bug while setting forced resolution on Hyper Light Drifter, a game that doesn't need forced 
        resolution, but I aways test all games I play to improve compatibility
        <li>Added a GetMessagePos hook. This is used to report the mouse position 'correctly' when forced resolution is enabled       
    </ul>    
        
    <h3>MCI</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>mciSendCommand: MCI_STATUS (track position), would return position of the next track when time format was milisseconds
        <li>mciSendCommand: MCI_PLAY would play the wrong track when time format was milisseconds, this fixes shadows of the empire  
    </ul>      
        
    <h3>FILE REDIRECTION</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Fixed bugs on the SHGetKnownFolderPath and SHGetFolderLocation hooks
        <li> New hooks to handle games the retrieve the special folders path from enviroment variables 
    </ul>   
    
    <h3>GAME SPECIFIC FIXES</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>Wheel of time, fixed a bug on FMV playback that caused the audio the game was playing before the FMV start, to continue playing  
        <li>Rainworld, fixed some incorrect values on the ini file which prevented the unfiltered upscaling from working   
    </ul>   
                        
    <h3>NEW GAMES</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>5 games that have cheat tables and nothing else: Guacamelee 1 and 2, Ori 1 and 2 and Iconoclasts
        <li>3 Games the benefit from forced resolution and also have cheat tables: SIGNALIS, Sphinyx and the cursed mummy and Star trek Klingon honour guard.
        The last benefits from several other fixed ass well
    </ul>      

    <h3>OTHER</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Restored compatibility with windows 7. The previous version required Win 8  and latter, this happened in the migration of the build system from 
            Qt creator\Qmake to Visual Studio\Cmake, but is fixed now
        <li>The GUI now runs on top of MS edge instead of Qt's webengine. This reduces the download size from about 50 MB to 5 MB  
        <li> Createprocess hook, When a 32 bit program launches a 64 bit program, the injector fails to 'inject' peixoto's patch on the child program, this wasn't
        entirely fixed, but at least in won't prevent the child program from 
        starting, this fixes freezing on TR reboot
    </ul>      

    <h3>CHEAT TABLES</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Star trek Deep space nine - the fallen
        <li> Star trek Klingon honour guard
        <li>The Wheel of time
        <li> Iconoclasts  
        <li> Half Life 2 and episodes
        <li> Ori 1 and 2
        <li> Guacamelee 1 and 2
        <li>Rune 
        <li> Improved Deus Ex Heuristics
        <li> SIGNALIS
        <li> Fixed one hit kill glitch in control             - uploaded jun 06
        <li> Fixed RTCW attaching (still need manual attach)  - uploaded jun 01
        <li> Fixed inf Ammo on wolfenstein 2009               - uploaded jun 01 
        <li> Septerra core, added one hit kills               - uploaded jun 01 
    </ul>
