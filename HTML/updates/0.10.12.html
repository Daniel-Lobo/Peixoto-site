    <h3 class='tile'>DirectDraw\Direct3D - 7 and earlier - Passthrough layer implemented
    </h3> 
    <h3>   
    Passthrough layer for DirectDraw and Direct3D - 7 and ealier - implemented. This doesn't change anything right now, but will
    help maintain compatiblity in the future</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li><b>DirectDraw and Direct3D - 7 and ealier:</b> Passthrough layer implemented. All currently supported DirectX 7 and earlier games work with the layer</li>
        <li><b>Deprecations:</b> Some games were <i>"deprecated"</i>. I can't test over 50 games everytime I make a change that can affect said games, 
        so I'm keeping only my favorites and deprecating some. This means that I don't test or offer support for these games anymore, but their profiles
        are still included and warnings were added for each deprecated game with the last patch version 
        it was tested with. So far, I only deprecated DirectX 7 and earlier games. Deprecated games never use the passtrought layer, you'll have to
        create a new profiole if you wish to do so
