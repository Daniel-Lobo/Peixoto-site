    <h3 class='tile'>Textureswap refactoring and a whole lot more</h3>
    <p> This update focused mostly on the texture swap option. I wanted do to a big  
        refactoring, share as much code as possible between all the APIs, implement the
        auto dump option for all the APIs and solve bugs. In the end, I've made less 
        then I originally intended to, because it was taking to long and I really want t
        o focus on the passthought layers next. Regardless, a lot was done in this 
        update</p>
    
    <p>    Starting with some additions</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>DirectX7:</b> Added the "Alpha textures fix" option. This was created to fix fonts
          on Blade of darkness and may solve other bugs on other games that use alpha 
          only textures. The correct rendering of fonts on Blade of darkness depends on 
          alpha textures returning 1.0 for the color channels when sampled on the pixel 
          stage. With the introduction of the programable pipeline, 
          <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/direct3dhlsl/texld---ps-2-0'>
          the default  value of the color channels in alpha only textures on the pixel shader was set
          to 0.0.</a> On windows vista - and latter,
          <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/display/converting-the-direct3d-fixed-function-state'>
          the  Direct3D runtimes implement the fixed function pipeline with shaders</a>
         
          What I'm guessing happened here was that, at that point, the MS programers did not 
          correctly replicated the fixed function alpha textures behavior on the pixel 
          shaders emulating the fixed function pipeline.   
          This fix is applied by replacing alpha only textures with full RGBA textures 
          with the color channels set to 255.
          
        <li><b>DirectX7 and earlier:</b> Replaced the "FMV fix" option with the "GDI hooks" 
          option. The old video for windows API, as well as the earliest DirectShow 
          versions and also quicktime output video using GDI. The old "FMV fix" option
          hooked 2 GDI functions - BitBlt and StretchBlt - to correctly upscale the FMVs 
          when forced resolution is enabled, on games using these APIs. The hooks were 
          now expanded - PatBlt, TextOutA and ExtTextOutA - to fix the menus on 
          Hyperblade. I find unlikely that this will matter for other games. The 
          Hyperblade demo is a Win16 program. So the game was probably Win16 GDI and 
          was ported to Win32 Direct3D close to launch, keeping the existing code for 
          the menus. Latter DirectDraw\Direct3D games DO use GDI A LOT, but they use GDI 
          to draw on a DirectDraw surface, and this is already handled
          
        <li><b>DirectX7 and earlier:</b> New Win32 hooks. When forced resolution is enabled, some 
          Win32 functions the game my call to retrieve the display resolution or window 
          size are hooked. DirectDraw\Direct3D games don't use this a lot, so it was 
          always handle case by case with game specific scripts. Now a set hooks with 
          code common for all APIs is used. A common set of hooks is also used by the
          "Fix window size" option. This doesn't change anything for the already
          included games, but may help with future inclusions 
          
        <li><b>DirectX8:</b> IDirect3DDevice8::DrawIndexPrimitive and 
          IDirect3DDevice8::DrawIndexPrimitiveUp are now hooked improving forced 
          resolution compatibility. Forced resolution is now usable in Project Eden
          
        <li><b>DirectX9:</b> Added the "Borderless Fullscreen Window" option. This solves some 
          bugs when forced resolution is enabled, like games crashing with alt-tab 
          
        <li><b>DirectX9:</b> Improved the "Fix window size" and added the "Resize window on 
          device creation" options. The "Fix window size" option exists for all APIs to 
          correctly resize the game window when forced resolution is enabled. On 
          Direct3D9 it will never look like the game window was not correctly resized
          - except if borderless fullscreen is enabled - because Direct3D9 will not 
          clip the output to the window client area, but if the window is not correctly
          resized, it will loose focus to the desktop when you click on it 
          
        <li><b>DirectX 10 and 11:</b> Added the "forced vsync" option
        
        <li><b>Opengl:</b> Improved forced resolution: The "resolution limit" option was added 
          to handle games on which render resolution is not coupled with the display 
          resolution. The functions glBitmap, glReadPixels, glDrawPixels, glReadRegion 
          and glDrawRegion are now hooked. Improved the hooks on functions used to 
          retrieve the display resolution and window size. Mouse hooks are now safe 
          if called on a different thread then that making opengl calls
        
        <li><b>All APIs:</b> added a option to use a default replacement for all texture dumps 
          missing a corresponding replacement
          
        <li>Extended the autodump option to Direct3D 7, 8 and 9 and opengl. This option
          is still work in progress, but together with the option above, I can dump and 
          replace several texture at once and this helps immensely to find and 
          fix bugs. Texture swap as a whole now has a smaller CPU overhead and a much 
          smaller memory overhead when dumps are not compiled 
    </ul>      
          
    <p>Now some things that were fixed: </p>  
        
    <ul>
        <li> Fixed autodump dumping all the mipmap levels on DirectX6 and earlier
        <li> Fixed textures - and shaders - being dumped but not replaced in DirectX 10
        <li> Fixed replacements not working except if they had the same number of mipmaps as the original texture on DirectX 10 and 11
        <li>Fixed some textures being replaced, but the replacement being immediately discarded in Opengl - affects Anachronox 
        <li>Fixed a bug loading compressed textures on Opengl
        <li> Fixed crashes on Max Payne. This bug as quite nasty, because it would cause  the game to crash even if you tried to start it without peixoto's patch. The
            "fix" disables texture swapping even if you enable it on the GUI, so it still needs improvement
        <li> Fixed unresponsive menus on Die by the sword. This is a simple fix using the "QueryPerformanceCounter fix" option introduced in the previous update
        <li> Fixed FMVs in Nocturne: the FMvs are now correctly upscaled. I'm aware of a extremely annoying issue in nocturne in the transition from gameplay to menus.
             I'll try to fix it... eventually 
        <li> Fixed a bug loading saves in Revenant  
        <li> Fixed a memory leak on the MCI emulator
        <li> Fixed crashes on FEAR when accessing the performance menu - needs fullscreen borderless window 
    </ul>          
                             
    <p> Finally, 6 new games supported: </p>    
    <ul> 
        <li> Hyperblade: some glitches on the menus were fixed and also benefits from forced resolution and Super sampling anti-aliasing 
        <li> Prince of persia and Bermuda Syndrome: not the original games but sld 
          reimplementations of their engines: <a href='https://github.com/NagyD/SDLPoP'>SDL-POP</a> and
          <a href='https://github.com/cyxx/bermuda'>bermuda</a> Both benefit from xBRz upscaling
        <li> Blade of darkness: Fixes texts and the non working Gamma\Brighness\Conrtrast controls on Direct3D mode. 
             Forced resolution and Super sampling anti-aliasing work on both Direct3D and OpenGl
        <li> Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein-2009, both benefit from Forced resolution\Super sampling anti-aliasing 
    </ul>
