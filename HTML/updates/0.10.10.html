    <h3 class='tile'>DirectSound Passthrough layer and EAX emulation.
    </h3> 
    <h3>   
        EAX emulation is a work in progress, only eax 1 and 2 are supported and some 
        bells and whistles of eax 2.0 reverb are not yet implemented. A better 
        implementation will be added in the next update which will also improve some 
        aspects of the DirectInput layer before we can go back to graphics on version
        0.10.12. The positional sound implementation however will remain very basic for 
        now: distance attenuation, sound cones and a simple left and right panning</h3>
