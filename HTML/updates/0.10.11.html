    <h1 class='tile'>Version 0.10.11 - September, 22, 2023</h1>
    <h3 class='tile'>EAX compatiblity expanded, new cheat tables and a few other small additions and fixes
    </h3> 
    <h3>   
    I took my time creating a lot of new cheat tables, it helps with testing, specially with EAX that requires visiting
    diferent areas of the game. Almost every supported game now has a cheat table and EAX - versions 1, 2 and 3 - now 
    have a pretty decent compatibility, reverb and muffleling. Here are a few other updates:</h3>   
    <ul>
        <li><b>Max Payne 2 added:</b> Benefits from forced resolution\super sampling anti-aliasing and EAX emulation</li>
        <li><b>Direct3D 11:</b> added forced triple buffering</li>  
        <li><b>Opengl:</b> fixed the glreadpixels hook. This affects the save game thumbnais on Munch's oddysee when SSAA is enabled</li>  
        <li><b>DirectInput:</b> Fixed a bug on the IDirectInputDevice::GetEffectStatus method. With this, force feedback now works correctly on star wars racer</li>          
        <li><b>Prince of persia 3D:</b> Fixed a bug that caused the screen not to be cleared before FMV playback</li>
        <li><b>Munch's Oddysse:</b> The <i>fix window size</i> option is now enabled by default fixing some crashes</li>
        <li><b>Revenant:</b> The map now works correctly on hardware mode. The map normally doesn't work on hardware mode because
               the game tries to use a system memory texture to render it. The fix is implemented by copying the texture 
               data to a hardware texture and will be made available in future updates as an option to be applyed to any game</li>
        <li><b>Silver:</b> Added 60 fps limitation, fixing a lot of bugs</li>
        <li><b>Save redirection:</b> The <a href='https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/processenv/nf-processenv-getenvironmentstrings'>
        GetEnvironmentStrings</a> hook now handles the APPDATA enviroment variable</li>
    </ul>      
    <p>0.10.11</p>
