    <h1 class='tile'>May, 31, 2022, Small update</h1>
    <p> This is still Version 0.10.8, as none of the binaries or scripts were altered. 
        I've just updated the Cheat Engine cheat tables - and the accompanying scripts  
        that run with my Cheat Engine AutoHotkey plugin - to make them more consistent. 
        Now all tables have, as much as possible, similar cheats and hotkeys. The most
        common cheats are:</p>
    <ul>    
        <li>Infinite HP
        <li>Easy Kills: this is 1 hit kills on most games, but on some - guacamelee, Control - it is 2 hits, 
            and on others - soul reaver - is more complicated 
        <li>Infinite Ammo or Magic
        <li>Gain currency: money, XP, etc. You press a key to gain a certain amount of
          currency. On games that have some kind of currency, this is the best way to 
          implement a cheat: it is easy to code, and you don't have to acquire any 
          amount of currency before using the cheat
    </ul>
    <p>Cheat tables are gonna be a thing on Peixoto's patch, many more are coming in
    the future, the ones included now are:</p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Control - DX11 and DX12, only inf HP and easy kill at the moment
        <li>DeusEx 
        <li> Guacamelee!
        <li> Horace
        <li> Halo custom edition
        <li> Legacy of kain: Blood omen
        <li> Legacy of kain: Blood omen 2
        <li> Legacy of kain: Soul Reaver
        <li> Legacy of kain: Soul Reaver 2
        <li> Legacy of kain: Defiance
        <li> Onimusha
        <li> Ori and the blind forest
        <li> Return to castle wolfenstein - inf ammo broken
        <li> Septerra core - missing inf HP at the moment
        <li> Unreal Gold
        <li> Wolfenstein - 2009 
    </ul>
